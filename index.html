        <h2>Mittens!</h2>
        <p>
            A kind, gentle soul, Mittens is the oldest of the 3 cats. 
        </p>
        <p>
            He likes to lay on the couch, look out the side door window, and, of course, get pet! 
        </p>
        <p>
            He has a two-colored nose and the softest belly you've ever seen.
        </p>
        <img id="james" class="cat-pics" src="./images/james-chair.jpg">
        <h2>James!</h2>
        <p>
            Rambunctious and a cuddlebug, James is the youngest of the 3 cats. 
        </p>
        <p>
            He has the most energy of the 3 and is always trying to play with something or scratch something.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he is very sleepy, he gets these adorable little bags under his eyes.
        </p>
        <img id="corn" class="cat-pics" src="./images/corn-eye.jpg">
        <h2>Corn!</h2>
        <p>
            Corn has a playful and lovable attitude, and is the "middle child" of the 3 cats.
        </p>
        <p>
            He likes to play and scratch like James, but when he's hungry he SCREAMS like he hasn't eaten in weeks!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you haven't noticed already, he only has 1 eye! He had to have surgery because of an infection but he's so much better now.
